I’ve made this tutorial because there’s no installer for the Linux versions of Sublime Text.
I will show you how to integrate Sublime Text to Unity
So let’s get on with this. Here is my how to install Sublime Text on Ubuntu tutorial.
[This tutorial has been updated following feedback from AskUbuntu. Also, you need to do these steps using your login. Do not start by typing "sudo -s"!]


Step 1 – Download
Download the tar file that suits you best and extract it. http://www.sublimetext.com/
$ tar xvf Sublime\ Text\ 2.0.1\ x64.tar.bz2
$ mv SublimeText2.0.2\ x64.tar.bz2 Sublime
Step 2
You’ll get a “Sublime Text 2″ folder after extraction.
his folder contains all the files that Sublime Text will need.
$ sudo mv Sublime\ Text\ 2  /opt/


Step 3
Now you’d want to be able to call Sublime Text from the Terminal by just typing “sublime”.
To do that, we’ll just create a symbolic link in “/usr/bin” like thus:
$ sudo ln -s /opt/Sublime\ Text\ 2/sublime_text /usr/bin/sublime

Step 4
Now that our files are at the right place, we need to create a launcher in Unity.

To do this, we’re going to create a .desktop file in “/usr/share/applications”:
$ sudo vi /usr/share/applications/sublime.desktop

And paste the following content:
[Desktop Entry]
Version=1.0
Name=Sublime Text 2
# Only KDE 4 seems to use GenericName, so we reuse the KDE strings.
# From Ubuntu's language-pack-kde-XX-base packages, version 9.04-20090413.
GenericName=Text Editor

Exec=sublime
Terminal=false
Icon=/opt/Sublime Text 2/Icon/48x48/sublime_text.png
Type=Application
Categories=TextEditor;IDE;Development
X-Ayatana-Desktop-Shortcuts=NewWindow
[NewWindow Shortcut Group]
Name=New Window
Exec=sublime -n
TargetEnvironment=Unity
As you can see, these lines are quite straightforward. Go ahead and experiment a bit with them.

Step 5
Now you would probably want to open all text files with Sublime Text 2.
The easiest way to do that is to open up the file associations list:
sudo sublime /usr/share/applications/defaults.list
And replace all occurrences of gedit.desktop with sublime.desktop. Tada ! There you go. You now have Sublime Text 2 installed on Unity on Ubuntu 12.04, like a pro. Here are some screenshots:
